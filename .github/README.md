This is a Unreal Engine 5 implementation of Stable Diffusion. It provides a streamlined
GUI inside Unreal Engine to easily generate game-ready textures among other features. You can run Automatic1111 or InvokeAI as the backend server.

### Installation

This plugin supports several SD backends. You can find individual installation instructions
below. Install Automatic1111 Stable Diffusion and/or InvokeAI

- #### [1a] Follow the install instructions at [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) and get that running normally
- #### [1b] Follow the install instructions at [invoke-ai/InvokeAI](https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI) and get that running normally (WIP, use the legacy_InvokeAI in the meantime before I add support for their new API)
- #### [2] Copy the Unreal/Unreal_Diffusion folder into your Unreal plugin folder either for the project or the engine install location
- #### [3] Go to Plugins in unreal and then enable the "Unreal Diffusion" plugin and restart the engine

- #### [4] Navigate to project settings then add the install location of Automatic1111 and/or InvokeAI in the settings
![editor settings](/Unreal/docs/unreal_plugin_settings.png)
- #### [4.1] Also add /Lib/site-packages from your python 3 install location on your computer like in the image below

- #### [5] (Optional) Go to Editor Preferences in Unreal and then "Loading & Saving" 
- #### [5.1] Add the "/outputs/img-samples/unreal-diffusion" to the Directories to monitor list to automatically import the generated images to unreal. You can map these to /Game/Unreal_Diffusion/Output as in the image below

### Features

#### Major Features

### Unreal UI
- Realtime - toggle that will generate the images without freezing unreal, but may generate slower. Off by default
- Seamless - Forces SD to generate seamless images. Sometimes you could try to have this off and instead type seamless in the prompt


Most docs here link to InvokeAI's as they are very detailed and show usecases and syntax

# Contributing

Anyone who wishes to contribute to this project, whether documentation, features, bug fixes, code
cleanup, testing, or code reviews, is very much encouraged to do so. If you are unfamiliar with how
to contribute to GitHub projects, here is a
[Getting Started Guide](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github).

A full set of contribution guidelines, along with templates, are in progress, but for now the most
important thing is to **make your pull request against the "development" branch**, and not against
"main". This will help keep public breakage to a minimum and will allow you to propose more radical
changes.

### Contributors

This fork is at the moment handled by me, with the main features/backend API coming from InvokeAI.

### Support

For support, please use this repository's GitHub Issues tracking service. Feel free to send me an
email if you use and like the plugin.
