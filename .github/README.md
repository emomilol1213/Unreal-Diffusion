### Running the plugin

First switch to the correct folder and conda environment and then start the server. It should say "Point your browser at xxxxxxx" if launched succesfully
 ```bash
(base) conda activate invokeai
```
 ```bash
(invokeai) cd C:\AI\Unreal-Diffusion (example, depending on where you cloned the repo)
```
 ```bash
(invokeai) python scripts/legacy_api.py --web --port 3333 -o outputs/img-samples/unreal-diffusion
```

Back in unreal, go to the Unreal Diffusion folder and find the "Unreal_Diffusion" Editor Utility Widget, right-click that and press "Run Editor Utility Widget as in the image below.

### Features

#### Major Features

### Unreal UI
- Realtime - toggle that will generate the images without freezing unreal, but may generate slower. Off by default
- Seamless - Forces SD to generate seamless images. Sometimes you could try to have this off and instead type seamless in the prompt



Most docs here link to InvokeAI's as they are very detailed and show usecases and syntax

- [Prompts and Prompt Blending](https://invoke-ai.github.io/InvokeAI/features/PROMPTS/#prompt-blending)
- [Negative Prompts](https://invoke-ai.github.io/InvokeAI/features/PROMPTS/#negative-and-unconditioned-prompts)

- [Image To Image(WIP)](https://invoke-ai.github.io/InvokeAI/features/IMG2IMG/) 
- [Upscaling(WIP)](https://invoke-ai.github.io/InvokeAI/features/POSTPROCESS/)
- [Variations(WIP)](https://invoke-ai.github.io/InvokeAI/features/VARIATIONS/)

### Latest Changes

- v0.5.0 (23 October 2022)
  - initial version with prompt/negative prompts, cfg, steps features


### Troubleshooting

If the images won't generate due to VRAM, try lowering the resolution or temporarily load an empty level in unreal to generate images.

# Contributing

Anyone who wishes to contribute to this project, whether documentation, features, bug fixes, code
cleanup, testing, or code reviews, is very much encouraged to do so. If you are unfamiliar with how
to contribute to GitHub projects, here is a
[Getting Started Guide](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github).

A full set of contribution guidelines, along with templates, are in progress, but for now the most
important thing is to **make your pull request against the "development" branch**, and not against
"main". This will help keep public breakage to a minimum and will allow you to propose more radical
changes.

### Contributors

This fork is at the moment handled by me, with the main features/backend API coming from InvokeAI.

### Support

For support, please use this repository's GitHub Issues tracking service. Feel free to send me an
email if you use and like the plugin.
